### Task - Redesign Gaming Benchmark Result Page

I have redesigned the sample result page so it is both descriptive and engaging to the user. Given the time frame, I defined a scope for prompt delivery. 
Listed below are a few of the tasks I have completed as part of the scope,
- Used D3 to display the score in an effective manner
- Compartmentalised data to reduce cognitive load
- Employed a heuristic approach to present information to the user
- Applied vibrant colours to make the interface lively
- Structured the stylesheet and used SCSS for uncomplicated maintenance and easy redesign

The following tasks are in the pipeline and excluded from the present scope,
- Design an icon set (I have currently used graphic images in place of icons)
- Design for mobile (The page is designed for desktop and is only partially responsive)
- Refactor script for improved efficiency

1. run 'npm install'
2. run 'npm start'
